# Personal Finance Tracker

## 1. Summary of CRUD Operations

The Personal Finance Tracker is a web-based application designed to help users manage their income, expenses, and keep track of their personal finances. The application uses full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to manage their financial records. Users can create new income and expense entries, update existing records when necessary, and remove outdated or incorrect entries.

The app also includes the ability to categorize income and expenses, offering users a more organized way to view their financial data. Furthermore, it enables users to track monthly summaries to see how much they've earned and spent over time. To ensure security, the app uses JWT-based authentication, requiring users to log in or register before performing any financial transactions.

Through this intuitive system, users can efficiently manage their finances, analyze spending patterns, and make informed decisions. The RESTful API provided is built using Express.js for routing, MongoDB for database management, and JWT for secure authentication.
